            <h1 class="">Massimo Troisi</h1>

            <img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.cinema.de/sites/default/files/styles/cin_landscape_510/public/sync/cms3.cinema.de/imgdb/import/dreams2/1000/701/2/1000701277.jpg?h=80accfed&itok=yfNtFWpZ" alt="Massimp">

            <section class="mt-4 maxwidth">
                <p>Troisi was born into a large family in San Giorgio a Cremano, a town near Naples. His father Alfredo was a train engineer. Some of his family experiences were later told in his first films. After secondary school, Troisi wrote some poems
                    inspired by his favourite author, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and, in 1969, started to play in a small local theatre together with some childhood friends (including Lello Arena and Enzo Decaro). The early death of his mother condemned Troisi
                    to a harsh period of activity, which is said to have had a role in the development of his increasingly serious heart problems which were brought on during his teenage years from bouts of rheumatic fever. (In 1976 he had to visit the
                    United States for a heart valve operation, the expenses for which were paid with the help of his friends.)</p>
                <p>Troisi started his artistic career as a cabaret showman in 1972, as a member of the comic trio called "I Saraceni" ("The Saracens") and, later, "La Smorfia" (from the name of the "book of the numbers" traditionally used in Naples for lottery
                    and tombola, but also meaning "the face", as in "to make a face"). His mates were De Caro and Arena. They gained national fame on the radio and increased it consistently from 1977 onwards eventually becoming TV stars with the shows
                    Non Stop, La sberla (1978) and Luna Park (1979). Troisi soon gained the status of leader of the trio. He was noted for his use of facial mimicry and of apparently confused speech—in these he drew inspiration from such famous figures
                    of Neapolitan comedy as Totò, and Eduardo and Peppino De Filippo.</p>
